# Password Generator Starter Code
The goal of this project was to create a user friendly secure password generator. To do this the user is presented with multiple different window prompts in order to specify what criteria of the password is needed(i.e. length, uppercase, lowercase.) When the user specifies what criteria they need, the password generator will create a unique password.
